## What is Lexecon?

Lexecon provides a complete governance framework for AI systems by combining lexicoding-forward policy models with runtime gating and tamper-evident ledgers. It ensures that AI systems operate within defined boundaries, with every action being cryptographically auditable.

### Key Capabilities

- **🔐 Lexicoding-Forward Policies**: Policy as lexicon (terms/nodes) + relations (edges)
- **⚡ Runtime Gating**: Every tool call must pass through decision service
- **🔗 Cryptographic Auditability**: Ed25519 signatures on all decisions
- **🛡️ Capability Enforcement**: Cryptographically authorized actions only
- **🤖 Model Integration**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models
